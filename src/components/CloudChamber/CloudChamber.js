        <h1>Cloud Chamber</h1>
        <p>One of the coolest things in nature is how particles are constantly whizzing around us and through us, but at the same time they are imperceptible to human senses.</p>
        <p>I wanted to show what these particles would look like if we could somehow see them. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_chamber">Cloud Chamber</a> is how scientists achieve this, so if you have your own, you can probably stop reading ;). Unfortunately, I could not find any video footage of one that I felt did it justice. </p>
        <p>So I set out to create a visualisation of a Cloud Chamber in action:</p>
        { codePenEmbedComponent }
        <p> </p>
        <h4>rules</h4>
        <p>Particles are emitted from the center of the page, with a random velocity.</p>
        <p>Particles are under the effect of a uniform magnetic field pointing into the page, which causes the path of charged particles to curve.</p>
        <p>Particles always belong to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation" target="_blank">one of three types:</a></p>
        <ul>
          <li><i>Alpha particles</i>, which are heavy and have a positive charge.</li>
          <li><i>Beta particles</i>: which are light and have negative charge.</li>
          <li><i>Gamma particles</i>, which are massless and have a no charge.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Particles are moving through a medium that uniformly decelerates them.</p>
        <p>Decay or collision may happen to a particle at any point - changing it from one type of particle to another and giving it a new direction.</p>
