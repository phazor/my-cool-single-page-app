        <h1>Cloud Chamber</h1>
        <p>On of the coolest things in nature is how particles are constantly whizzing around us and through us, yet they are imperceptible to the human senses.</p>
        <p>I wanted to show what particles would look like if we could somehow see them. Fortunately there is already a way, in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_chamber">Cloud Chamber</a>, however I could not find clear video footage of one. </p>
        <p>So I set out to create a visualisation of a Cloud Chamber in action:</p>
        { reactComponent }
        <p>Particles are generated in the center of the page, with a random velocity</p>
        <p>Particles are under the effect of a magnetic field, and are moving through a medium that slows them down.</p>
        <span>Three types of particles exist:</span>
        <ul>
          <li><i>Alpha particles</i>, which are heavy and have a positive charge.</li>
          <li><i>Beta particles</i>: which are light and have negative charge (they are fundamentally electrons).</li>
          <li><i>Gamma particles</i>, which are massless and have a no charge.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Decay may happen to a particle at any point - changing it from one type of particle to another and randomising its new direction.</p>
